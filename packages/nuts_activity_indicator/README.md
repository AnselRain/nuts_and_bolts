# `nuts_activity_indicator`

> [`dartsidedev`](https://github.com/dartsidedev)

This package is part of the `nuts_and_bolt` package.

The "Nuts and bolts" packages are based on the official [`cupertino`](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/cupertino) and [`material`](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/material) widgets with greater customizability. It exposes the nuts and bolts of the original widgets (I'm great at naming things, I know).

The `nuts_activity_indicator` package is based on the [`cupertino` library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/cupertino-library.html)'s [`CupertinoActivityIndicator`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoActivityIndicator-class.html) widget.
