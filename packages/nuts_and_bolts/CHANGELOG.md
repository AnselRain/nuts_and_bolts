## `0.1.1` - July 4, 2019

**Please welcome our first widget: `NutsActivityIndicator`**

`NutsActivityIndicator` is based on the `cupertino` `ActivityIndicator`, with more hooks and customizability, so spinner color, tick count and tick width can be changed.

Other changes:

* a proper example app, so that developers can see how the widgets from this package work
* preparing for CI/CD: dartanalyzer and dartfmt run locally, but we'll add them soon enough to a CI pipeline

## `0.1.0` - July 3, 2019

**Let's get this party started!**
