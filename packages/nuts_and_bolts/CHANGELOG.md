## `0.2.0`

**Restructure project**

* extract `NutsActivityIndicator` into its own package and export it from the `nuts_and_bolts` "umbrella" package.

## `0.1.1`

**Please welcome our first widget: `NutsActivityIndicator`**

`NutsActivityIndicator` is based on the `cupertino` `ActivityIndicator`, with more hooks and customizability, so spinner color, tick count and tick width can be changed.

Other changes:

* a proper example app, so that developers can see how the widgets from this package work
* preparing for CI/CD: dartanalyzer and dartfmt run locally, but we'll add them soon enough to a CI pipeline

## `0.1.0`

**Let's get this party started!**
