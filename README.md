# `nuts_and_bolts`

My goal with this package is to provide more customizability to the widgets in the `material` and `cupertino` libraries. I found that many (ok, well, at least one) of the official widgets can be easily tweaked to support a greater customizability, therefore making your app unique and pixel-perfect.

This project is in its early days, so expect API changes.
